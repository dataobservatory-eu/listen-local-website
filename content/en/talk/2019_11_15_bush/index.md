I am going to look back on the needs assessment of [Hungarian music professionals](https://danielantal.eu/talk/2019_10_09_praha/post/2015-11-12_cstp/) in 2015 and [Czechs](https://danielantal.eu/talk/2019_10_09_praha/) in 2019.I will also compare the problems of the Hungarian scene in 2015, 2019 with the current issues in Czechia, Slovakia and Austria.  

I would like to provide an opportunity on BUSH to give personal feedback to the artists and professionals who gave their personal details in our annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey from Hungary, or anywhere else in the region if they make it to BUSH. More details will be sent to your e-mail addresses, provided you have given us one.
