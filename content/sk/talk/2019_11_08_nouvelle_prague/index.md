I am going to present the Czech results from our regional [Central European Music Industry Report](https://danielantal.eu/post/2019-09-27_cee_report/), and the first version of a comprehensive, national music development program that we started to work on in the organization of SoundCzech with 25 music professionals representing more than 20 stakeholders in the [How We Would Like To Work in the Czech Music Industry in 2020](https://danielantal.eu/talk/2019_10_09_praha/) _ex ante_ evaluation workshop.

I would like to provide an opportunity on Nouvelle Prague to give personal feedback to the artists and professionals who gave their personal details in our annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey from Czechia, or anywhere else in the region if they make it to Nouvelle Prague. More details will be sent to your e-mail addresses, provided you have given us one.
